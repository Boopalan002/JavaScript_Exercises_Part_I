  /* Further Adventures
   *
   * 1) Run the program
   *
   * 2) In the console tab, click after the blue arrow.
   *    Type location.city followed by Enter
   *    to show the city property.
   *
   * Hmmmm, something's not right!
   *
   * 3) Type location and press Enter
   *    to display the whole location object.
   *
   * Okay, that's definitely not our location object.
   *
   * This is an example of a variable collision.
   * Browsers (and jsBin) are programs themselves and
   * create their own variables.
   * Other code, not ours, has declared its own
   * location variable, over-writing ours.
   *
   * 4) Change our location variable, now calling
   *    it geolocation.
   *    Repeat steps 1, 2 and 3, using geolocation
   *    instead of location.
