  /* Further Adventures
   *
   * 1) Run the program.
   * 
   * The getGuesser and guess variables will be
   * added to the global scope, the collection of
   * variables avaialable on the console and
   * throughout the program.
   *
   * 2) At the prompt, type 'getGuesser' and
   *    press Enter.
   *
   * The value of the getGuesser variable will be
   * shown on the console. The value is a function
   * so the function will be displayed.
   *
   * Notice, JS Bin has replaced the calls to
   * console.log with its own logging function.
   *
   * 3) At the prompt, type 'guess' and
   *    press Enter.
   *
   * The value of guess is displayed.
   *
   * 4) At the prompt, type 'secret' and
   *    press Enter.
   *
   * secret is not a global variable. It is local
   * to the getGuesser function and cannot be accessed
   * on the console.
